# Poornima Library - Dynamic Website & Admin Panel ðŸ“šâœ¨

This project is a fully functional, dynamic website for the Poornima University Library. It features a modern, responsive public-facing website and a secure admin panel for staff to manage content in real-time without touching any code.

4.  **Create initial data files:**
    In the main project folder, create three new, empty files:
    * `notices.json`
    * `links.json`
    * `gallery.json`

    Open each file and put empty square brackets `[]` inside, then save.
